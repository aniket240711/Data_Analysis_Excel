## Areas To Improve

- Low Revenue in Some Occasions: Festivals like Diwali and Holi show much lower revenue compared to occasions like Birthdays and Anniversaries, These categories may need better marketing or product bundles.

- Uneven City Performance: A few cities have very high order numbers while many others show extremely low engagement, Expanding delivery reach or running targeted promotions could help balance this.

- Delivery Speed Variations: Although the average delivery time is around 5.5 days, certain quantity levels still show slight inconsistency (up to 5.84 days), This indicates room for improving logistics for bulk or special orders.

- Product Popularity Gaps: Some products show significantly lower popularity compared to top sellers like Magnam Set and Quia Gift, These low-selling items may need redesigning, rebranding, or discounting.

- Revenue Concentration: A large share of revenue is driven by only a few top products and occasions, Increasing product variety or introducing new collections can reduce dependency on limited categories.

- Seasonal Fluctuations: Monthly revenue shows noticeable ups and downs , Running off-season campaigns can help maintain more stable monthly sales.
